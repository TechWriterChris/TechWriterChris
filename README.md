# Hi, I'm Christine!

I'm a technical writer with a background in professional writing, instructional content, and applied tech. I use GitHub to share documentation-focused projects and occasional code samples that support my writing work.

Most of my content here ties into real-world writing, data analysis, and automation tasks I've worked on—like guiding others through API usage or building practical tools with generative AI.

You won’t find hundreds of repos here—but you will find clarity, structure, and purpose in what I share.

More to come soon!
